# ADR-0001: Accessibility Implementation Approach for Search Functionality

Date: 2025-12-09

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics documentation site requires an accessible search functionality that complies with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. The search must be fully usable by people with disabilities, including those who rely on keyboard navigation and screen readers. The solution must include proper ARIA attributes, keyboard shortcuts, focus management, and high contrast support.

## Decision
We will implement accessibility features using the following approach:
- ARIA attributes: Use proper roles, states, and properties for all search components
- Keyboard navigation: Support Tab, Arrow keys, Enter, and Escape navigation with shortcuts like Ctrl+K
- Focus management: Clear visual focus indicators and proper focus trapping
- Screen reader support: ARIA labels and announcements for all interactive elements
- High contrast mode: Support for system high contrast settings
- Reduced motion: Respect user's motion preferences

## Consequences
### Positive
- Ensures the search is usable by all users, including those with disabilities
- Complies with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines for accessibility
- Provides a better overall user experience for all users
- Reduces legal risk related to accessibility compliance
- Increases the potential audience for the documentation

### Negative
- Requires additional development and testing time
- More complex implementation with ARIA attributes and focus management
- Need for accessibility testing with assistive technologies
- Additional CSS for accessibility states and high contrast modes

## Alternatives
### Alternative 1: Basic accessibility compliance (WCAG A level)
- Pros: Less development time and complexity
- Cons: Would exclude users with certain disabilities, doesn't meet AA requirement

### Alternative 2: Outsource accessibility implementation
- Pros: Potentially faster implementation with expert knowledge
- Cons: Higher cost, less control over implementation, potential communication issues

### Alternative 3: Add accessibility as an afterthought
- Pros: Faster initial development
- Cons: More expensive to retrofit, potential for overlooking important aspects, violates accessibility-first approach
