## 📊 🎓 Course Overview 📊

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## 🤖 🧠 Physical AI Principles 🤖

Physical AI represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space. This approach focuses on:

- Understanding physical laws and their impact on AI systems
- Developing embodied intelligence that interacts with the real world
- Creating AI systems that function in reality rather than just simulations
- Integrating real-world sensorimotor experiences into AI models

## 🤖 🤖 Humanoid Robotics Focus 🤖

Our curriculum specifically emphasizes humanoid robotics because:

- Humanoid robots excel in human-centered environments due to their shared physical form
- They can be trained with abundant data from human interaction environments
- They represent the pinnacle of embodied intelligence challenges
- They require integration of multiple complex systems (locomotion, manipulation, perception)

### 🤖 ⚡ Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) 🤖
Focus: Middleware for robot control.
- ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids

### 🎮 🎮 Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) 🎮
Focus: Physics simulation and environment building.
- Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
- High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity
- Simulating sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs

### 🤖 🚀 Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) 🤖
Focus: Advanced perception and training.
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim: Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Isaac ROS: Hardware-accelerated VSLAM (Visual SLAM) and navigation
